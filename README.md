## Installation

1. Place [ImNotAsking.dll](https://github.com/XDelta/ImNotAsking/releases/latest/download/ImNotAsking.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create this folder for you.
